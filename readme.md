# Face Detection with OpenCV

This Python script uses OpenCV to perform face detection in an image. It loads an image, converts it to grayscale, and then detects and highlights faces by drawing rectangles around them.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library (you can install it using `pip install opencv-python`)

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have OpenCV installed.

2. Create a folder named "photo_face_detection" in the same directory as your script.

3. Place the image you want to process inside the "photo_face_detection" folder. Ensure that the image is named "Rihanna.jpg."

4. Run the `main.py` script.

5. The script will load the image, convert it to grayscale, and detect faces using the Haar Cascade Classifier provided by OpenCV.

6. Detected faces will be outlined with rectangles in blue.

7. The result will be displayed in a window titled "Facial Recognition."

8. Press any key to close the window and exit the program.

## Example

Suppose you have an image named "Rihanna.jpg" in the "photo_face_detection" folder.

After running the script, it will display the image with rectangles drawn around detected faces.


Feel free to use this script for various face detection tasks or extend it for your specific needs!
